Back in 2016, when I was working a slow shift at the local Italian restaurant, I stumbled upon the idea of creating my own role-playing game, or RPG. After several iterations, the project is now underway.

The cryso-map project leverages Swing to create a GUI and two control bars, which allow editing of "tiles" and "entities". Tiles are the surface of the map, describing where entities can be placed; entities are objects that move around on top of the grid.

The map project is still in its early stages; planned changes include an XML or JSON file to dynamically load textures for tiles and tokens, more refined control of movement for tokens, and hopefully some updated textures.
